					<p>Redcoat is a Node.js application. It is designed to run on a web server so that annotators can access it from their own computers. The installation and setup process is outlined below.</p>

					<h2 id="installing-nodejs">Installing Node.js</h2>

					<div class="pad-hor">
						<p>The first step is to install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>.</p>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>If you are using Ubuntu</strong>, you can install Node.js and npm by using the following commands:</p>
								<code class="code-block">
									<span class="dollar">$</span> sudo apt-get update<br/>
									<span class="dollar">$</span> sudo apt-get install nodejs<br/>
									<span class="dollar">$</span> sudo apt-get install npm
								</code>
							</li>
							<li><strong>If you are using Windows</strong>, simply download the Windows installer and follow the instructions. Ensure that npm is also installed (it should be included with the installation by default).</li>
							<li><strong>If you are using Mac OS X</strong>, you can download an installer from the Node.js website. Alternatively, the following command should install both node.js and npm using homebrew:<br/>
							<code class="code-block">
								<span class="dollar">$</span> brew install node<br/>
							</code>
							</li>
						<p>For additional installation instructions, please see the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> website.</p>
					</div>


					<h2 id="running-the-redcoat-application">Running the Redcoat Application</h2>
					<div class="pad-hor">
						<p>Download the latest version of Redcoat <a style="color: red" href="https://github.com/githubtraining/hellogitworld/archive/master.zip">here</a>.</p>
						<p>Unzip the folder and navigate to the folder's location using command prompt/terminal. You'll then need to install the required node packages using npm:</p>
						<code class="code-block">
							<span class="dollar">$</span> npm install<br/>
						</code>
						<p>This may take some time depending on the speed of your internet connection.</p>
						<p>Once the packages have been installed, you should be able to run the application using:</p>
						<code class="code-block">
							<span class="dollar">$</span> npm start<br/>
						</code>
						<h3 id="creating-the-admin-account">Creating the Administrator Account</h3>
							<p class="pad-hor">If this is your first time running the application, you'll be greeted with a message asking for a username and password for the Administrator account. This is a necessary step to ensure that only you are able to set up your project through the browser.</p>
							

						<h3 id="configuring-smtp-details">Configuring SMTP Details</h3>
						<div class="pad-hor">
							<p>You'll also be asked whether you want to send out invitations to annotators using your own STMP server.</p>

							<p><strong><i class="icon-right-open"></i>If you answer with 'y'</strong>, you'll be able to enter the host, port, and authentication credentials for your SMTP server. Sending out your annotation project using your own SMTP server will be enabled as an option when setting up your project. </p>

							<p>For example, if you have a Gmail account, you can Gmail's SMTP server by entering the following: </p>
							<code class="code-block">
								<strong>SMTP server name:</strong> smtp.gmail.com<br/>
								<strong>SMTP username:</strong> your Gmail address<br/>
								<strong>SMTP password:</strong> your password<br/>
								<strong>SMTP port:</strong> 465<br/>
							</code>	
							<p><strong><i class="icon-right-open"></i>If you answer with 'n' (or blank)</strong>, you can enter your SMTP details in the <code>mailer.js</code> file at any time. Until you do, you won't have the option to send out your annotation project using your own SMTP server. You will still be able to send out the project manually, as Redcoat will provide you with a list of URLs to distribute via email.</p>

					<h2 id="setting-up-a-new-project">Setting up a New Project</h2>
					<div class="pad-hor">
						<figure class="figure-right-small">
							<img src="../../public/images/redcoat-setup.png"/>
							<figcaption>Redcoat's setup page.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>Once the server is up and running, you can continue the rest of the setup process in a browser such as Firefox or Chrome.</p>
						<p>If you are running the application on your own computer, navigate to <code>localhost:3000</code> in your browser.</p>
						<p>If you are running the application on a web server (and have set up the server using something like ssh), you can (optionally) close the ssh connection and navigate to <code>&lt;your server's IP address&gt;:3000</code> in your computer's browser. You'll need to ensure that port 3000 is open.</p>
						<p>In your browser you can log in using the administrator account details you entered earlier and begin setting up a project.</p>

						<h3 id="required-information">Required Information</h3>
						<div class="pad-hor">
							<p> The setup page is fairly self-explanatory, but we have included the required details here.</p>						
							<table id="setup-project-table">
								<thead>
									<tr>
										<th>Section</th>
										<th>Required Information</th>
									</tr>
								</thead>
								<tbody>
									<tr>
										<td><strong>Project Details</strong></td>
										<td>Enter the <strong>project name</strong> and a <strong>brief description</strong> of the project. The description will appear in the automated mailouts if you decide to use them.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td><strong>Dataset</strong></td>
										<td>Determine whether your data has already been tokenized. There are two options to choose from:
										<ul>
											<li><strong>"Yes, my data has been tokenized":</strong> You'll be asked to upload your tokenized data. The dataset must be saved as a .txt file. Each token within your data must be separated by a newline, and each record must be separated by an additional newline. <a href="../../public/files/example_tokenized.txt" download>Click here</a> to download a small example file.</li>
											<li><strong>"No, my data has not been tokenized":</strong> You'll be asked to upload your untokenized data. The dataset must be saved as a .txt file. Each record within your data must be separated by a new line. <a href="../../public/files/example_untokenized.txt" download>Click here</a> to download a small example file. Your data will be tokenized using regular expression parsing.</li>
											
										</ul>
										<em>Please note, it's highly recommended that you provide your own tokenized data. Providing untokenized data is only recommended for quickly trying out Redcoat.</em></td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td><strong>Entity Categories</strong></td>
										<td>Determine how you would prefer to upload the entity categories. There are three options to choose from:
											<ul>
												<li><strong>"My entity categories are saved in a file":</strong> You'll be asked to upload your entity categories. The list of entity categories must be saved as a .txt file. Each line in the file must contain an entity category, followed by a tab character, followed by an abbreviated form of that entity (such as PER for "Person").<br/>You may optionally add a tag colour by adding an additional tab character and a 6-digit hexadecimal colour code to the end of the line. This will determine the colour of the respective entity's label during annotation.<br/>
													<a href="../../public/files/example_categories.txt" download>Click here</a> to download a small example file.</li>
												<li><strong>"I'll list the entity categories here": </strong> You'll be asked to enter your entity categories into the table that appears on the setup form. The "Abbreviation" will determine what is written in the output file after annotation, while the "Colour" will determine the colour of the tag during annotation.</li>
												<li><strong>"I'm using the standard 4 class model for Named Entity Recognition":</strong> your entity classes will be "Person", "Location", "Organization" and "Misc". This option is provided to serve as a shortcut for users performing NER.</li>
											</ul>
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td><strong>Distribution</strong></td>
										<td>Determine how you would like to distribute the annotation task. There are four options to choose from:
											<ul>
												<li><strong>"I'll complete the annotation task myself":</strong> Redcoat won't generate any URLs for you to send out to annotators. When submitting the setup form, you'll be able to start annotating right away. You can resume annotation at any time by logging in again using your administrator credentials</li>
												<li><strong>"I'd like a list of codes that I will send to the annotators myself":</strong> You'll be asked to provide the <strong>number of annotators</strong> that will be working on your project. You will also be asked for the <strong>server address</strong> (such as your server's IP address or domain name). Redcoat will divide your dataset into batches (1 per annotator) and will generate a list of randomly-generated URLs, such as <code>&lt;your server's address&gt;:3000/annotation/sHd36CJL9z</code>. You can email one of these URLs to each annotator.</li>
												<!--
												<li><strong>"I'd like the server to email codes to the annotators automatically":</strong> You'll be asked to provide the number of annotators that will be working on your project. Redcoat will send a message to our mailer server, which will email 1 URL to each annotator automatically.</li>
												-->
												<li><strong>"I've provided SMTP credentials and want to use my SMTP server to email codes to each annotator":</strong> This option will become available if you entered your SMTP credentials when setting up the server (see <a href="#configuring-smtp-details">Configuring SMTP Details</a>). You'll be asked to provide the <strong>number of annotators</strong> that will be working on your project, and the <strong>server address</strong>. Redcoat will attempt to use your SMTP server to send out 1 URL (as above) to each annotator via email.</li>
											</ul>
										</td>

						<p>Each annotator's respective dataset is separated into groups of 10 records. One group will appear in the browser at a time, and completing one group of records will save the results to a JSON database and allow users to progress to the next group.</p>

						<table class="controls-table">

					<div class="pad-hor">
						<p>While the annotation is underway, you can check the results by visiting <code>&lt;your server's address&gt;:3000/results</code> in your browser, and logging in using your administration account. You'll also be able to reach this page via the homepage after a project has been created.</p>
						<p>On the results page you'll be able to view how many records have been annotated, along with the number of entities belonging to each class. If you elected to distribute the project to multiple annotators, the page will show progress bars for each annotator indicating how close they are to completion.</p>
